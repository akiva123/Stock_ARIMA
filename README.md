# Stock Price Forecasting Using ARIMA

## 📚 Overview

This project leverages statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices using ARIMA models. Apple's stock data (ticker: `AAPL`) is used as a case study, fetched from Yahoo Finance. The pipeline incorporates data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and visualization to deliver robust and reliable forecasts.

This repository provides a ready-to-use and adaptable implementation that has been tested for accuracy and compliance with statistical modeling best practices. Its modular structure ensures that it can be easily extended or modified for other time series datasets and use cases.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Data Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends, seasonality, exponentially smooth the series to uncover patterns, and test for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
- **Autocorrelation Analysis**: Use Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) and Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF) plots to identify model parameters.

### 🛠️ Model Building
- **Automated Model Selection**: Use `pmdarima.auto_arima` for automatic parameter tuning.
- **Customizable SARIMA**: Integrate seasonal adjustments for time series with periodic trends.

### 🧪 Model Validation
- **Residual Analysis**: Ensure the model's residuals are white noise using the Ljung-Box test.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate predictions with Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 📈 Forecasting
- **Future Predictions**: Generate reliable forecasts and compare them to test data.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Plot results to easily interpret forecast accuracy.
